  - Conda virtual environment for code reproducibility
- Final notebook:
  - Compiled group member's work together
  - Fix bugs such as full OS paths versus relative paths (e.g. `"Documents/../data"` versus `"../data"`)
  - Render final notebook at `html` as a failsafe
  - Add extra packages to virtual enviroment
- Project administration:
  - Grading instructions on `README.md` of this repo
- Data scraping:
  - [üë©‚Äçüíª Ai-Yukino/athena](https://github.com/Ai-Yukino/athena/)
    - Multiple notebooks

### Other comments

- Data scraping even text data from well-formated data such as tables on Wikipedia is not easy to automate
  - Hard coding even small details like column names you expect to be the same across pages can break code
- I need to learn how to explain and justify command-line nonsense better
  - Why use Conda virtual environments? Why not just install everything in the base environment in Anaconda?
  - Why use [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with `.py` files instead of directly uploading `.ipynb` files?
  - Why should we care about version control issues with `.ipynb` files? GitHub ironically offers rendering for `.ipynb` but not `html` files anyways.
