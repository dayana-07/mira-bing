### Other comments

- Data scraping even text data from well-formated data such as tables on Wikipedia is not easy to automate
  - Hard coding even small details like column names you expect to be the same across pages can break code
- I need to learn how to explain and justify command-line nonsense better
  - Why use Conda virtual environments? Why not just install everything in the base environment in Anaconda?
  - Why use [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with `.py` files instead of directly uploading `.ipynb` files?
  - Why should we care about version control issues with `.ipynb` files? GitHub ironically offers rendering for `.ipynb` but not `html` files anyways.
